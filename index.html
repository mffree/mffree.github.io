	<p>Hey this is Matthew.</p>
	<p>My friends call me Freeman.</p>
	<p>I live in the city.</p>
	<p>For fun I like to play tennis, go out to eat, watch movies, play golf, read books, watch sports, sing, read articles, drink oat milk mochas, lay in the sun, practice guitar, devise economic theories, practice French, play around on the computer - but I'm down for whatever. I do NOT enjoy cooking but do it to survive.</p>
	<ul>My favorite TV shows include:
		<li>Homeland</li>
		<li>Succession</li>
		<li>New Girl</li>
		<li>How I Met Your Mother</li>
		<li>Le Bureau des Legends</li>
		<li>Billions</li>
		<li>Silicon Valley</li>
		<li>Rubicon</li></ul>
	<p>If you have somehow encountered this website without already knowing me, feel free to hit me up me at first name + last name + 63 at gmail dot com.</p>
	<p>I guess you can connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-freeman-78985682/">LinkedIn</a> if you want but I mean you really don't have to.</p>
